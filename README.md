# Overview

The Joystream Community Repo is a resource by the Joystream community with [archived testnet content](archives) by founding members.

Although the community controls the repo, Jsgenesis has final say to approve and merge pull requests with code. The content is licensed under [GPLv3](/LICENSE). Community members with merge permission are @mochet and @traumschule.

## Workflow

The workflow for changing the repo depends on the reason and purpose behind the change.
A consistent part is for the contributor to fork the repo, and create a pull request to the applicable branch.
All changes need to be approved with a proposal, except for selected [files](governance/Files_and_Folders_Naming_Rules.md).

### Revisions & Improvements of Submissions
* For general updates (updating links, text) these can just be gathered occasionally and submitted as a rolling update like this example: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/proposals/14 This does mean that it will take some time for the PRs to be approved by the council.
* In the event of some highly important change, a proposal could be made so that the matter is addressed more quickly than waiting for a rolling update
* If users want to be paid for updates or corrections, then they should open a PR (or multiple PRs) and link to it in a spending proposal, when this is approved it would have the same effect as approving the PR (which still has to be reviewed by Jsgenesis)
* As an example, if a user wants to add functionality to the telegram bot and be paid for it, they can open a PR and create a spending proposal linking to the PR
