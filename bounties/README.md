# Development

## Pioneer

### Bounties v2

During testnets we had a very successful on-chain module (pallet) for bounties. Since the runtime side was improved by the founding company JS Genesis there are parts in our QN and the governance app Pioneer that need to be updated to make it work again.

## Joystream CLI

The command line interface enable to interact with the Joystream chain directly without UI. It was greated by JS Genesis and has never been updated by the community.

We are looking for a new community maintainer with experience how to structure interactive interfaces. To get started pick a functionality from the wish-list and submit a [PR](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/compare).

### Advertising system prototype

a website or proof of concept of paying tokens to make an on-chain remark and paying a set fee (or bidding) and being able to buy advertising space. This would be a really cool feature to have at even a prototype level and could expand the incentives for app operators
