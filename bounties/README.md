## Pioneer
[testnet bounties backlog](https://github.com/Joystream/pioneer/labels/bounty-backlog)

### Bounties v2
During testnets we had a very successful on-chain module (pallet) for bounties. Since the runtime side was improved by the founding company JS Genesis there are parts in our QN and the governance app Pioneer that need to be updated to make it work again.

## CDN: Argus / Colossus

| Title  | Description | Reward | Status |
|--|--|--|--|
| Curator tools | a tool for reviewing all videos, in which it will be possible to view each video and channel and moderate the tags of each video or channel. |  |
| Content Directory stats website | a website that can display information the content uploaded to Joystream including video length, size, channel, uploader, categories, tags etc. |  |
| Worker/lead remark forum | a website that allows for workers and leads to use the extrinsics which enable them to make on-chain remarks using their keys. This could be used to have a daily standup of each DAO worker (if it applies to their role) and would make tracking activity a lot easier than relying on Discord |  |
| Advertising system prototype | a website or proof of concept of paying tokens to make an on-chain remark and paying a set fee (or bidding) and being able to buy advertising space. This would be a really cool feature to have at even a prototype level and could expand the incentives for app operators | high |
| NFT statistics website | information about current and historical NFT sales to give a viewer a good idea about the current market activity on Joystream for NFTs |  |
